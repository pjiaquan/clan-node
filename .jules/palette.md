## 2024-05-20 - Adding loading states for async actions

**Learning:** This application inconsistently implements loading indicators on critical form submissions (authentication, setup, invite acceptance, and modal submissions). While some buttons (like in `EditPersonModal`) disable appropriately and show inline spinners, the majority of forms lack visual feedback during submission. This results in users experiencing uncertainty after form submission and could lead to multiple clicks, as well as breaking accessibility expectations for async feedback.

**Action:** Consistently adopt the `.btn-inline-spinner` alongside disabling buttons during `submitting` states across all `btn-primary` submit buttons.
